# Moodle Database: Educational Data Log Analysis

## Business Need 

Many educational facilities such as colleges, universities, bootcamps rely on scalable and versatile Learning Management Systems. 

The Moodle LMS  is a free and open-source learning management system written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License. 

It is used for blended learning, distance education, flipped classroom and other e-learning projects in schools, universities, workplaces and other sectors. 

With customizable management features, it is used to create private websites with online courses for educators and trainers to achieve learning goals. 

## Challenge

Your challenge: assuming a role-model of a freelancer hired by 10 Academy, you are to explore the 10 Academy Moodle logs stored in the database together with many other relevant tables. By the end of your analysis, you are expected to build a Tableau dashboard that illustrates the progress of students across time.
